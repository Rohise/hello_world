===========

Following the tutorial, new to this whole thing

Just going along, probably will use this so that I can stop abusing the [code][/code] feature on /g/.
Rest will remain blank until I actually do something.

Tutorial wants me to say something about myself. Not sure what that means. I'm new to the world of programming, and barely
started using Antergos as my OS instead of windows. I did manage to make a fairly broken Rock Paper Scissors game in C++ as
well as a poorly written password storage thing in C#, and by poorly written I mean: everything was hardcoded because I
can't into reading from and writing to files. 

For folks who just hop around repos, sorry for dissapointing you all.
